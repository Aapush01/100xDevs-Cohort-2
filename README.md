- Zerodha end to end
- Zapier end to end
- E-commerce

## Learning Goals

-During this course, my main learning goals include:

1. Mastering the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack for full-stack web development.
2. Gaining proficiency in DevOps practices, including continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)  pipelines, containerization with Docker, and orchestration with Kubernetes.
3. Developing a solid understanding of machine design principles, including algorithms, data structures, and design patterns, to build efficient and scalable software solutions.

These learning goals align with my aspirations to become a proficient Software engineer and broaden my skill set to encompass full-stack development and DevOps practices.
 

## Technologies Used

MERN Stack:

MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing data.
Express.js: A Node.js web application framework used for building web applications and APIs.
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime used for server-side scripting.

DevOps:

Git: Version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development.

GitHub: Platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories.

Docker: Containerization platform used for packaging and deploying applications.

Kubernetes: Container orchestration platform used for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Tools: Examples include Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, etc.

Testing Frameworks: Such as Jest for JavaScript testing or Pytest for Python testing.

Machine Design:

Algorithms: Data structures and algorithms such as sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, etc.
Design Patterns: Reusable solutions to common problems in software design, such as Singleton, Observer, Factory, etc.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
Programming Languages: JavaScript, Python, etc.
