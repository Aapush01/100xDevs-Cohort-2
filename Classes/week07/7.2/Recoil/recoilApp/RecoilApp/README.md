# Recoil Learning Journey

Welcome to my Recoil learning journey repository! This is where I document my progress, notes, and examples as I learn how to manage state in React applications using Recoil.

## Introduction

Recoil is a state management library for React that provides a simple and flexible way to manage state in your applications. It is developed by Facebook and aims to address the limitations of other state management solutions like Redux and Context API.

In this repository, I'll be exploring the core concepts of Recoil, implementing various examples, and sharing resources that I find helpful along the way.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into Recoil, make sure you have a basic understanding of the following:

- React (hooks, functional components, etc.)
- JavaScript (ES6+ syntax)

## Installation

To get started with Recoil, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aapush01/recoil-learning-journey.git
    cd recoil-learning-journey
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Learning Plan

Here's a roadmap of what I plan to cover in this learning journey:

1. **Introduction to Recoil:**
   - What is Recoil?
   - Why use Recoil over other state management libraries?

2. **Core Concepts:**
   - Atoms
   - Selectors
   - RecoilRoot
   - Recoil hooks (useRecoilState, useRecoilValue, etc.)

3. **Advanced Topics:**
   - Async Selectors
   - Recoil Persistence
   - Recoil with Context API
   - Recoil and Suspense

4. **Practical Examples:**
   - Todo List
   - User Authentication
   - Form Management
   - API Data Fetching

## Resources
